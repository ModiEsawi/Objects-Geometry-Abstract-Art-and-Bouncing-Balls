# Objects-Geometry-Abstract-Art-and-Bouncing-Balls
in this project we will be working with objects , define classes and instantiate objects of those classes as an intrudotion to OOP in java.

## Geometry
the first part will talk about Geometry where we would be working with points and Lines, 
and create random lines with points that mark their intersection and middle point , just like the following.

## Animation and Bouncing Balls
in this part we will draw balls (which are basically circles) and move them across the screen.

when can create X balls which will move faster if they are smaller , and slower if they are bigger , we will see an example in the next animation.

## Multiple Frames

Now we will create two frames - one of them is a grey rectangle from (50,50) to (500,500),
and the other is a yellow rectangle from (450,450) to (600,600). We will set that the first half of the balls will bounce inside the first frame,
and the second half of the balls will bounce inside the second frame.
